[Functions]
- Possibly support recursion?

[Array Manipulation] *this may require internalization*
- Assign at index `myvar[0] = 1`
- Access value at index `myvar[0]`
- Slice operations `myvar[0:2]`

[Loops]
- For / While loops

[Conditionals]
- Redesign if output to a skip-first implementation
    - Try to make else condition first, skipping if conditions are true rather than inverting conditions

[Attributes]
- Common properties should be accessed using dot notation
- <Vector>.X -> X Component Of(Vector)
- <Player>.jumping, <Player>.crouching, <Player>.ability1?

[Tests]
- Make more tests, document them
- Create gamemodes using the language to prove its effectiveness

[Bugs]
- Arithmetic broken for multiple operators
- Event Player on msg
- Ignore condition on wait
- Non-empty advertisement
